### In this repository:
- Sigma 30mm f1.4 EX HSM Canon EF Aperture Control and Mount Conversion

### Background Story:
My preferred FOV for everyday photography is around 42-45mm. People keep telling me it's the most natural FOV to match our eye's FOV. Yes, we see a lot peripherally, but the main content lies within that 42-45mm FOV on a 135 camera. I've read very good reviews of the 30mm f1.4 EX HSM and I had one on hand from trying to push the low light capabilities of my GH5 with a speedbooster. These days my GH5 has a Rokinon 21mm f1.4 lens stuck to it or the 12-40mm when I need that zoom. In my search for the perfect lens for my Olympus PEN-F half frame camera, I was using an old 28mm f4 for it's size, but I wanted better low light performance as well as wonderful rendering.

Which leads us here. I took apart the Sigma 30mm and drafted some parts to mate to the iris to allow me to control it manually. Then added a PEN-F mount at the approximate correct distance to register inifinity. After getting acceptable focus, I did a quick and dirty F-stop identification mounting the lens on my Sony A7RII and added detents on the lens for these stops. I find 3D printed numbers/lettering pretty bad so I just made a label with the f-stops using the arc length between the stops and the overall throw of the iris. 

I love it so much. It's super sharp on half frame -- something I've found hard to realize with half frame. It's a little unwieldly with the large size of the 30mm but the results are worth it for me.

### What you'll need:
- 9-13x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (PETG) or self-tappin screws (ABS or PETG)
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit
- Micro files
- PTFE synthetic grease

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientationFile.3mf' files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore for screw holes that aren't tapped.

Test fit before assembling. Will need to file parts to allow free movement. You may need to drill out the original mounting holes on the Minitar lens assembly for the m1.6 screws to fit. 

Lightly grease the inside of the mount where the aperture clutch runs.

To assemble correctly, please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.
